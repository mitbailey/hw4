# Homework Assignment 4 Part 1
## Notes
___

jQuery Validation now stops the user from entering values greater than 64 or less than -64 (this is a step backwards from my previous implementation, which could catch this and correct it).

Custom Validation messages are displayed directly above the offending text input field(s), and provide an indication of how to fix the issue. The offending text input field(s) are also outlined in red.

Green boxed input fields indicate valid entries.

Page never reloads, its not necessary.
